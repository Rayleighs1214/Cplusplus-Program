// Q & A: 
  - Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
      The project was to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. There was a given list of produce items what were purchased on a sample day from when the store opened till closed. Corner Grocer wants to know how often the items are purchased so they can create a more effective layout for the customers. There are also three required functions for this program. Function one is where there is a prompt that asks what the user is looking for and then shows the frequency of the specific word. Function two is where it prints the frequency of all items purchased next to the searched word (ex1. Potatoes 4). Function three is where it prints the same frequency information for all the items in the form of a histogram (ex2. Potatoes ****). It is important to include at least one class with public and private sections. Using Maps is also recommended for implementation. 
    
  - What did you do particularly well?
      I feel like I did well following the customer's needs and not giving up on my own projects. Throughout this course, there's been many times where I've been late in turning in assignments (including this week) but I'm still pulling through and trying to finish this course without failure. 
      
  - Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
      Perhaps I could increase the efficiency by having a more direct line of code. I'm not sure if the coding would be increased in efficiency, readability, and transparency if I don't use private and public sections but it would be interesting to try that route to compare. 
      
  - Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
      It was really challenging to write the public sections, especially the ones where I had to write the codes for all the cases (case 1 ~ 4). I kept having errors during the beginning stages of writing these codes due to small human errors such as missing semi colons, losing track of where I was going with it, etc. I was able to overcome this by having a break on writing the codes since I could tell my focus has been rough. 
      
  - What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
      I believe most of the skills I've learned from this project could come in handy with future projects, but keeping the private/public sections while using void function will probably be the most useful. At least that's what I would guess so since I'm not sure what projects I'll be working on in the future.
