// Q & A: 
  - Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
      The project was to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. There was a given list of produce items what were purchased on a sample day from when the store opened till closed. Corner Grocer wants to know         how often the items are purchased so they can create a more effective layout for the customers. There are also three required functions for this program. Function one is where there is a prompt that asks what the user        is looking for and then shows the frequency of the specific word. Function two is where it prints the frequency of all items purchased next to the searched word (ex1. Potatoes 4). Function three is where it prints the        same frequency information for all the items in the form of a histogram (ex2. Potatoes ****). It is important to include at least one class with public and private sections. Using Maps is also recommended for                 implementation.
